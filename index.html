    Experiment #1: Create a generator that iterates through all combinations of an arbitrary array of characters sets.
    </br>
    </br>
    What's the point if you can download precalcuated tables of hash combinations?  A generator can do the same work, but without the complications of download a large file, etc.
    </br>
    </br>
    This first attempt shows all the combinations of a four character key using only "ABCD"
