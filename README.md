# Welcome to my ES6 generator experiment

I recently attended a talk on the new goodies in ES6.  Of course I knew ES6 was out int the wild but hadn't had a reason to dig in.  Well that changed when the subject of [generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*) was explained.  I'll confess that this was new to me.  I now know that generators are in many languages, but since javascript is my first language somehow they never caught my eye.

Serendipitously, I also just finished [The Code Book](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Book-Science-Secrecy-Cryptography/dp/0385495323) and decided crypto keys would be a good field for experimenting with this new javascript power.

Contained in this repo is a [github page](https://jdungan.github.io/keygen) for viewing my explorations.
